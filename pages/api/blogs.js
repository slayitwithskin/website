    intro: "Our skin is a remarkably sophisticated organ that serves as more than just a means of protection from the elements. And while water and air pollution can harm the skin's appearance and functionality, there are steps we can do to lessen the impact.\n",
    content: "5 tips to Protect Skin from Pollution \nWatch out for air pollution: Premature ageing of the skin is a result of airborne pollutants, notably on the hands, neck, and face. The UV radiation from the sun can interact with smog, pollution, and dust, producing free radicals that reduce the oxygen in skin cells and impair collagen synthesis. Because they damage cells and deteriorate DNA, these highly charged oxygen molecules are bad for the skin and the body. This can make skin look drab and grey and cause wrinkles, rough spots, and acne. Skin allergies, eczema, and blood vessel damage can all result from prolonged exposure. Wash your face every day, exfoliate your skin twice a week, and moisturise every day to protect your skin. According to studies, using antioxidant-rich goods, like green tea, may help reduce skin pollution.\nLimit your exposure to chlorine: It is harmful and can cause major irritation to your skin and lungs even though it is used to purify drinking water. Over time, the consequences can be detrimental even at tiny doses. When you take a shower, heat causes your pores to open, allowing chlorine to soak in and remove natural oils from your skin while also drying it out, which can cause wrinkles. Spend less time in chlorinated water, such as swimming pools.\nDon't do it to yourself: Simply put, smoking contributes to air pollution. Both first-hand and second-hand smoke can cause health problems. By constricting the blood vessels in your skin, it restricts blood flow to your skin, depleting oxygen and vital nutrients while also causing wrinkles. The fibres that give skin its flexibility and might lead it to wrinkle prematurely, elastin and collagen, are also harmed by smoking. Free radicals from cigarette and cigar smoke are a significant source of skin ageing and further skin damage.\nBlock the pollution: Pollution is impossible to totally avoid if you reside in a developed nation, but there are measures to lessen its impacts. Overexposure to UV radiation can result in skin cancer and wrinkles. A quality moisturiser moisturises the skin and fortifies it against pollution and free radicals. Wear sunscreen on your face and neck and take a daily vitamin C supplement to protect yourself.\nStay hydrated: One of the most abundant substances on Earth is also one of the finest defences in the fight for healthy skin. Water moisturises the skin, promotes cell growth, enhances circulation, reduces under-eye circles, and increases skin flexibility. You can filter your drinking water to get rid of chlorine and other chemicals to protect your skin from the impacts of water pollution. Your skin can be cleaned of air contaminants by washing it twice a day and exfoliating once a week. To avoid the possibly harmful effects of chlorine in tap water, think about switching to mineral water.\nAs we age, our skin naturally starts to lose moisture and suppleness, but by implementing some of these strategies, we can stop pollutants from quickening the process.\n\nVisit the websites and other resources on the following page to find out more about how to shield your skin from pollution.",

    title: "9 Toxic Ingredients in Your Hair Dyes To Avoid",
    slug: "9-toxic-ingredients-in-your-hair-dyes-to-avoid",
    intro: "We experimented with colouring our hair, much like the majority of people who have been in seclusion for the past 18 months. We used bright violets, ashy greys, and brilliant pinks in our dye tests. Even though they were beautiful, we managed to ignore the fact that the substances in the hair colour were hazardous and did more harm than we had anticipated.",
    content: "While the majority of hair colours and dyes are safe to use, some of them include dangerous chemicals that can affect the hair over time and make\n it dry, brittle, and even unhealthy. So use this as a PSA on learning hair colour and its dangerous elements if you intend to colour your hair.\n \n • Ammonia: Ammonia should be avoided at all costs because it is most likely the main factor in hair damage. Unfortunately, because it also exists in the form of its metabolites, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, and triethanolamine, it is also the most widespread. This alkaline chemical may aid in the proper absorption of the colour into the hair, but the result is dry, brittle, and unhealthful hair. Additionally, it smells terrible and irritates the nose and eyes, which can eventually lead to serious infections.\n \n • Paraphenylenediamine (PPD): The current pigment in the hair is removed by PPD, allowing the new colour to replace it. The poisonous substance, which is also known to be carcinogenic, can cause rhabdomyolysis, respiratory failure, and cardiac health problems if it is exposed to large amounts.\n \n • Para-toluenediamine (PTD): According to research, a concerning amount of PTD is absorbed via the skin as a person ages. This chemical can trigger allergies in hair stylists in addition to being harmful to the individual getting their hair coloured.\n \n • Peroxide: Peroxide, or hydrogen peroxide, is often used as a substitute for bleach since it's believed to be less harsh. Unfortunately, there's no truth to this widely held belief since lightening your hair with peroxide causes long-term cuticle damage, leading to frizz, split ends, and even breakage in the long run.\n \n • Resorcinol: Resorcinol is a chemical that shouldn't be used carelessly because it can affect not only your scalp but also your general health. It is flammable, can cause abdominal pain when inhaled, and can produce redness when it comes into contact with skin, which qualifies it as a hazardous chemical. Resorcinol is a known hormone disruptor with the potential to cause thyroid malfunction and harm your central nervous system, in addition to these allergic symptoms.\n \n • Quaternium-15: Make sure your hair colour doesn't contain quaternium-15 by checking the label. This substance is a well-known allergy and is found as a preservative in numerous cosmetic and hair products. According to Mahalli, it releases formaldehyde, which might cause a contact dermatitis reaction in susceptible individuals.\n \n • Sulphates: Sulphates have a long history of being bad for haircare, so we all saw this one coming. In case you didn't know, certain hair dyes contain sulphates to keep your mane tidy. However, sulphates can leave your hair incredibly weak, brittle, and prone to breaking when used in conjunction with bleach (which you'll need to if you're colouring your hair lighter).\n \n • Titanium Dioxide: You shouldn't be too concerned about titanium dioxide, a mineral that is used as a pigment in hair colouring products, but it is still wise to stay away from it. Although it's frequently found in sunscreens and is generally regarded as safe, it can be carcinogenic when inhaled in big doses, which is what happens when hair dye is applied.\n \n • Paraphenylenediamine: We won't lie: this chemical is a hassle to be around and its name is a pain to say. Because it enables the new colour to replace the old pigment, paraphenylenediamine, or PPD, is widely used in dyes. However, did you know that it is a chemical that can cause cancer? That implies that over exposure to it can result in side effects like respiratory failure and cardiac health problems. Yikes. PS: You don't have to toss away all of your dyes and stop using hair colours altogether just because you've read this list. You probably won't hurt yourself when used in very little, moderate amounts. Try to stay away from these ingredients as much as you can, though, just to be cautious. Instead, choose natural substances like henna, carrot, arnica, etc. that are sourced from plants. Have fun colouring!",

    intro: "Aging is a fact. And like many other adults, you may be wondering if there is anything you can do to stop the ageing process from showing on your skin. It's one of the most often asked questions dermatologists receive, claims dermatologist Melissa Piliang, MD. But there's good news, she says. You can actually take a lot of steps to stop your skin from ageing. Just make a commitment to them. Here are four measures you may take to protect your skin from the effects of time.",
    content: "1. Protect your skin from the sun: UV radiation exposure accelerates the ageing process of your skin, leading to wrinkles and blotchy, rough skin. In actuality, sun exposure is the main cause of wrinkles, uneven pigmentation, and other skin ageing symptoms. By limiting the amount of time you spend in the sun and by always wearing protective clothing and a hat, you may protect your skin and avoid developing wrinkles in the future. Additionally, wear sunscreen outside on exposed skin all year round. \n \n2. Select items with built-in sunscreen: Choose skin care items with a minimum SPF of 15 when making your selection. SPF of 30 or above is advised by the American Academy of Dermatology. Use items that are water resistant and broad spectrum, which means they prevent UVA and UVB rays. Reapply sunscreen every two hours, or more frequently if you're swimming or perspiring. Apply sunscreen liberally. \n\n3. Use moisturizers: Although they can't stop wrinkles from forming, moisturisers can temporarily hide fine lines and creases by holding water in the skin.\n\n4. Don't smoke: The blood vessels in the topmost layers of your skin become narrowed as a result of smoking. Collagen and elastin, the fibres that give your skin strength and elasticity, are also harmed by it. Skin starts to sag and wrinkle as a result before it should. Even if you've smoked for a long time or frequently, stopping smoking will still enhance the texture and tone of your skin and delay the appearance of wrinkles.\n\n5. Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet: According to the results of a few studies, eating a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables may help avoid the harm that causes early skin ageing. Research findings also point to the possibility that a diet high in sugar or other refined carbs may hasten ageing.\n\nA dermatologist can assist you in developing a customised skin care regimen by determining your skin type, assessing the health of your skin, and recommending products that are likely to be successful. A dermatologist can suggest prescription creams, botulinum toxin (Botox) injections, or skin-resurfacing procedures if you want more dramatic results from your wrinkle treatments.",

You now know their trade secret. Whether it's to treat acne, black spots, dry skin, oily skin, or suntan, our grandmothers always have the best recipes for homemade face packs that are completely natural. The oldest science, Ayurveda, which promotes the use of natural face packs for healthy, glowing skin, is the source of this age-old knowledge that has been handed down through the years. Face Packs Based On The Skin Types Everybody has a different type of skin. The product that does wonders for your friend's skin might not work as well for you. Even Ayurveda advises using skincare items that are appropriate for our skin types.\n\nHere are three different face packs for dry, oily, and normal skin types.\n\n1. Curd and Gram Flour Face Pack For Dry Skin</br>Using the Curd and Besan face pack is a fantastic way to nourish your dry skin. The Besan helps in removing all of your dead cells while the Curd deeply moisturizes the skin.</br>What You Will Need:\n• Two tablespoons of Besan• One tablespoon of Curd\n• One teaspoon of Honey\n• A dash of Turmeric\n\nWhat You Have To Do?\nTake a glass bowl and mix all the four ingredients to make a smooth paste. Apply evenly all over the face and neck and leave for about 10 minutes. Now rinse it off with cold water. Besan and Honey deeply cleanse your skin, Curd helps in moisturizing and turmeric works as an antiseptic which maintains the pH levels of your skin. Therefore, all the ingredients put together can do wonders on dry skin.\nYour skin is thoroughly cleansed by besan and honey, moisturised by curd, and has its pH levels maintained by turmeric's antibacterial properties. The combination of all the components might therefore work wonders for dry skin.\n\n2. A face mask with lemon and honey for oily skin\nLemon is a fantastic skin-cleansing agent that also helps to get rid of dead skin cells and lessen oil production. With all of its antiseptic and antibacterial qualities, honey aids in preventing breakouts of acne and pimples by lowering oil output. Utilize this face pack to reduce excessive oil production and restore a soft, supple appearance to your skin.\nWhat You Need Is:\n• Juice from two teaspoons of lemon\n• Honey, one tablespoon\nWhat you must do?\nApply the mixture all over the face after combining Lemon juice and honey in a bowl. Dry it off and then wash it with lukewarm water.\n\n3. For normal skin or sensitive skin, use turmeric and besan As is common knowledge, turmeric is a natural antiseptic with anti- inflammatory, antibacterial, and anti-bacterial qualities that aid in treating sunburns and bacteria for sensitive skin. Besan is a great exfoliator that aids in eliminating dead skin cells and providing the skin with a deep clean. It also aids in keeping your skin's pH balance in check.\n\nWhat you need is:\n• Besan, one tablespoon\n• 0.5 tablespoons of ground turmeric\n• One tablespoon of rose water is all that is required.\n\nMake a thick paste by combining all three ingredients. Apply it next to your entire face and neck, then wait for around 15 minutes. Rinse it off completely now.\n\nAll of these recipes use natural ingredients, but it doesn't imply they are completely safe for you because you could have an allergy to any of the ingredients. Therefore, it is essential to perform a patch test on your hand before using them. If any ingredient is causing allergic reactions of any type, cease using it right once and seek medical attention if it becomes serious.",

If no moisturiser or skin cream is applied after washing, it usually feels \"tight\" and uncomfortable. Skin that is severely dry and dehydrated will crack and chap.",
    content: "1. Wash your face gently at least twice per day: Use a mild, alcohol- free, nonfoaming cleanser on your face twice day and right after you've worked up a sweat. Your skin can be repaired with products that include linoleic acid or stearic acid, which are both present in argan oil and shea butter, respectively. If you have sensitive skin, wash in the evening with a cleanser and simply rinse the rest of the time.\n\n2. Maintain Moisture : Keep your natural oils in place. Your skin naturally creates oils to protect it from the environment and keep it from drying out. But throughout the day, you engage in numerous activities that remove these natural oils. Your bathing habits pose the biggest risk to the natural defence system of your skin. Your skin is at risk from both soaps that remove too much oil from your skin and water that is too hot. Shower at the coolest setting you can tolerate, and only use soaps that say \"sensitive skin\" or contain moisturizers.\n<strong>Precautions:</b> Make cautious not to bathe too frequently or for too long. Both have the potential to remove too much of your natural oil. Take only one shower every day, for no longer than 10-15 minutes. Bathe only every other day if you can.\n\n3. Use a moisturising soap devoid of allergens: Use hypoallergenic (fragrance-free) moisturising soap when washing your hands. Then, while your hands are still damp, apply a moisturising cream. Try using a non-soap cleansing cream or shower gel in the shower or bath, and only use soap in places like the groyne and armpits when necessary. Avoid using pumice stones and loofahs. Rinse well, then pat yourself dry.\n\n4. Use a humidifier: Indoor air that is hot and dry can parch delicate skin and make itchiness and peeling worse. You can add moisture to the air in your home by using a portable humidifier or one that is connected to your furnace. \n\n5. Pick materials that are gentle on your skin:Cotton and other natural fabrics help your skin to breathe. Despite being natural, wool can occasionally irritate even healthy skin. Use laundry detergents free of dyes and fragrances, which can both irritate your skin. The word \"free\" is frequently used in the names of these products. \n\n6. Relieve itchiness: Apply a clean, cool, wet cloth to the itchy area if dry skin is to blame. Applying an anti-itch lotion or ointment with at least 1% hydrocortisone may also be an option. Consult your doctor or a dermatologist about developing a customised skin care regimen depending on your skin type and any existing skin conditions if these steps fail to relieve your symptoms or if they worsen.",

We'll go over the specifics below so you'll be better prepared to create a skincare routine that works for your skin. If you want to know your skin type you can read the this blog.3",
    content: "Step-by-step skin care routine for oily skin:\n\n1. Cleanse : Both in the morning and at night, wash your face. Cleanse your skin before bed to remove the grime that has accumulated over the day. Additionally, you should always wash your face in the morning even if your skin feels super-fresh. Your skin creates oils and loses skin cells while you sleep. Your skin may become overly glossy and break out as a result of this. Make use of a cleanser made with oily skin in mind. To help remove sebum (also known as oil) from pores, Shah prefers a mild salicylic acid cleanser like CeraVe SA Cleanser.\n\n2. Exfoliate : Exfoliating is a great technique to clear your pores of oil, dirt, and dead skin cells. Alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) and beta hydroxy acid are two active chemicals in chemical exfoliants that remove dead skin cells (BHA). The AHA glycolic acid is better for oily skin. Salicylic acid, another staple of BHAs, is also suitable for oily skin. Just be careful not to overdo it and limit your exfoliation to no more than twice a week. Excessive exfoliation might result in dry, irritated, or red skin. Plan to exfoliate at night because some components leave you more vulnerable to sunburn.\n\n3. Apply treatment : Retinol influence on cell turnover, it is excellent for minimising the appearance of wrinkles and can help smooth out the texture of your skin. Retinol also has the added benefit of minimising pores and aiding in the treatment of acne. In general, using active ingredients-containing products excessively can irritate your skin (such as acids or retinol). Consequently, just use once day at most (and sometimes less). Since these activities frequently make your skin sensitive to sunlight, nighttime is typically preferable. Since acne is a problem that frequently affects people with oily skin, you might wish to try an acne treatment instead. Acne-fighting products that contain sulphur, salicylic acid, or benzoyl peroxide can assist.\n\n4. Moisturize : You might believe that giving oily skin more moisture will do more harm than good. But in real life, it's a crucial step in your oily skin care regimen. People with oily skin frequently prefer gel moisturizers. \nIn general, oily skin can safely utilise moisturisers designed for acne- prone skin. Just be certain that your cream, gel, or lotion is:\n• Noncomedogenic\n• Oil-free\n• Lightweight\n• Water-based\n• Free from harsh chemicals or fragrances\n\n5. Apply SPF : It doesn't matter what type of skin you have—always wear sunscreen. \nYou should constantly apply an SPF 30 or greater in the morning, even on cloudy or rainy days. Just check the ingredient list to make sure nothing pore-clogging is included, such as:\n• Avobenzones\n• Oxyphenones\n• Benzophenones\n• Methoxycinnamate\n• Para - aminobenzoic acid(PABA)\n\nThis is for oily skin but if you want to know skin care routine for other skin types the you can check it out here.",

So, choose sulfate-free shampoos that are appropriate for all hair types. Without removing any of the moisture and natural oils from your strands, this will hydrate, smoothen, and detangle. \n\n2. For the dry, damaged or chemically treated hair \nYour hair's lengths can be prone to dryness and brittleness by nature. Additionally, if you've used chemical treatments to colour or straighten your hair, your hair may be more vulnerable to damage because it will be more sensitive to environmental pressures like pollution or photodamage. To nourish your damaged locks, use a shampoo that is protein-fortified and hair-strengthening. Amino acids and soy extracts are excellent for keeping coloured hair. To avoid drying out and colour loss, be careful to choose sulfate-free choices. \n\n3. Rough Hair \nYou need to wash your hair more frequently if you have rough hair. Choose a creamy, moisturising shampoo if you plan to use excessive amounts of hair product. Such ingredients like shea, coconut, or olive butter should be sought for.

Choose a shampoo that keeps your hair's radiance intact, shields it from the sun, and stops the colour from fading. It is preferable if your items contain UV filters to stop the colour from fading. One of the most important steps in your hair care routine is washing your hair with the appropriate shampoo. Shampoos have an impact on both your scalp and individual hair strands. \nAs a result, you should determine what kind of scalp and hair you have and select a shampoo accordingly.

    intro: "Combination skin might be challenging to take care of, but it is not impossible. To properly care for mixed skin, you must discover products that are effective on the various skin types present on your face and do not irritate it.",
    content: "You can care by using these natural remedies:\n\n1. Maintain a regular skin-care routine: Developing a daily and nightly skin care routine is essential for managing mixed skin. To help your skin adjust to the regimen, use the same products 1-2 times a day for at least a month.\n• Use a cleanser to wash your face once or twice every day. \n• Exfoliate seldom, occasionally just once each week. \n• Use a moisturiser to seal the deal every morning and night.\n\n2. Consider treating various facial regions: You will need to concentrate on treating two skin types with this skin type. You must moisturise the dry parts of your face and cut back on the extra oil on the oily parts. Your T-zone is frequently the greasy region of your face (your forehead, nose, above your mouth, and chin). \nDepending on your skin type, you will need to treat particular sections of your face as opposed to your entire face with one product. Use a spot treatment to target the oil only on your forehead, for instance, if you have a breakout on your forehead and are aware that this area is prone to oiliness. Use a moisturising product exclusively on the area of your cheeks where your skin is prone to becoming dry and irritated. \n\n3. On dry skin, use an oil-based cleanser: Coconut oil and olive oil- based cleansers are excellent for dry to very dry skin and may only be effective on the dry patches of combination skin. Although oil-based cleansers are not harmful to your skin, oily skin is not advised to use them. For a test period, you might want to try preparing a variety of various oil-based cleansers. Use a professional cleanser that has additional substances to more effectively treat oily skin if you begin to break out or experience adverse reactions. \n\n4. A natural exfoliant can be made: After washing your face, you can exfoliate your skin to remove dead skin cells, especially if there are any dry or dead skin cell-filled areas of your face. Exfoliating will help stop pores from getting clogged and skin from looking lifeless. Once or twice a week, begin by exfoliating with a homemade scrub. \n\n5. Use a natural spot remedy: Use spot treatments to get rid of blemishes and stop new acne from developing in your T-zone. By doing so, you will be able to focus on your face's acne-prone areas while avoiding bothering other areas. \n\n6. Use organic face wash: Once a week, use a face mask to offer your skin a soothing treatment and a fresher complexion. Several organic, all- natural face masks combine oils and fruits to create a fantastic paste for your face. • Blend together two carrots, a banana, half a papaya, and a cup of honey. The ingredients should be combined to create a thick paste. For 20 minutes, apply this paste to your face. After that, wash it off with warm water. \n• One tablespoon of natural yoghurt, one teaspoon of lemon juice, and two drops of lemon essential oil can be used to make a lemon yoghurt face mask. Spend ten minutes covering your face with the mask. After that, remove it with warm water. \n\nThis is how you can take care of your combination skin but in case you face any problem you should talk to your dermatologist."

With changes in the weather, so does our skin. Understanding these changes is crucial if you want to avoid problems like dullness, dryness, oiliness, and skin irritation, among others. The expert explained that nourishing the skin with a face serum is a simple method to prevent any of these skin problems. She went on to say that when purchasing a face serum, the following should be considered: \n\n<strong>How to determine your skin type</b> \n\n• Oily Skin: Skin that is oily produces an excessive amount of sebum, which makes it shiny and greasy. Overproduction of oil frequently causes plugged pores. \n\n• Dry Skin: Skin that is dry typically has a dull appearance and can occasionally become flaky, rough, and scaly. Additionally, it can be more likely to exhibit more obvious fine wrinkles and feel tight. \n\n• Normal Skin: Skin that is typical is balanced and neither too dry nor too oily. Additionally, normal skin doesn't break out frequently and doesn't respond poorly to changes in weather or cosmetics. \n\n• Combination Skin: When your skin has both dry and oily patches, you have combination skin. While the cheeks are often either dry or normal, the T-zone is frequently greasy. \n\n• Sensitive Skin: Skin that is sensitive is more susceptible to external irritants and may be affected by particular substances, such as fragrances or dyes, as well as environmental conditions. \n\n• Mature looking skin: All skin types can display ageing symptoms such wrinkles, sagging, dark patches, dullness, and dryness. \n\n<strong>Mark A List Of Ingredients</b> \nOnce you are aware of your skin type, conduct some short online research or speak with your dermatologist. List the items that would be best for  your skin type. When you enter the cosmetic store, you might feel tempted to test out several serums, but this strategy can backfire. Only use ingredients that are appropriate for your skin type or issue. It can be challenging for someone with regular skin to select a face serum. In this instance, though, you should seek out ingredients with a lot of punch, like vitamin C, which is effective on all skin types. Antioxidants found in vitamin C help treat common skin issues like dull skin, dark spots, and uneven skin tone. \nIn addition to caring for the skin with a nourishing serum, the expert said that one should monitor their lifestyle choices. She said that maintaining a healthy diet and avoiding stress will help one maintain their inner glow. \n\nWe hope that this guide will assist you in selecting the best face serum for you.

    intro: "\"You are what you eat,\" is a proverb that you've probably heard. The same idea also applies to your skin: Whatever you put on it gets absorbed right into your body. Knowing what you're putting into your body is important because your skin is the greatest organ in your body. \n\nHowever, if you've ever flipped over the label of your preferred facial cleanser, you may have found a lengthy list of unfamiliar components. The cosmetics business includes a variety of compounds in its products, from sulphates to parabens; some are helpful, while others may be detrimental. And many of them may possibly be harming your appearance rather than improving it. Discover five ingredients you should stay away from by reading on.",
    content: "1. Phthalate \nBased on the number and arrangement of the carbon molecules, there are various types of phthalates. Because they have several uses in the cosmetics business, phthalates are widely used. Phthalates are utilised in a variety of ways, including (1) as a solubilizer to dissolve chemicals, (2) as a humectant to keep items from drying out, (3) as an emollient to soften skin, and (4) as a plasticizer to make polymers more flexible. Sadly, there are connections between exposure to specific phthalates at high levels and male reproductive health. In addition to posing a risk to individuals, many water treatment facilities are unable to completely remove phthalates from drinking water. \n\n2. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate \nYou know the sensation of being spotlessly clean after washing your face? According to Jody Levine, M.D., assistant clinical instructor of dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, sodium lauryl sulphate, a common component added to face wash to make it foam, is to blame. She adds that many other personal care items, including shampoo, frequently include it. But sodium lauryl sulphate isn't simply found in the cosmetics section; it's also a component of engine degreasers, garage floor cleaners, and car washes. \nThe issue with sodium lauryl sulphate is that it depletes the skin (and scalp, in the case of shampoo), both of which are really in need of natural oils for protection, from these oils. Levine says that it \"may be highly irritating, especially if a person is allergic to it.\" According to studies, even small levels of allergens in items might result in adverse reactions. The body also produces extra oil (the same thing you're trying to get rid of) to make up for the loss of the skin's natural, protective oil. \n\n3. Fragrances \nA personal care product's perfumes are just included to give it a more pleasant smell. Most fragrances are semi-volatile in order to deliver smells quickly. There are valid reasons why you might want to use items without them even though they serve no practical purposes besides providing a pleasant smell. Some fragrance-making ingredients, particularly petroleum-based ones, have been linked to headaches, skin conditions, and other health problems. If you don't want to use a fragrance-free product, check for one with the label \"fragrance-free,\" as \"unscented\" items frequently still have fragrances in them. \n\n4. Parabens \nThe paraben family of chemicals includes a wide range of distinct chemical substances. The length of its carbon side chain is the key  characteristic that sets these related molecules apart. By keeping items stable throughout a wide variety of temperatures, parabens are used by the cosmetic and skin care sector to assist extend the shelf life of their products. Additionally, parabens have antibacterial qualities. Paraben exposure can have negative effects on male reproductive, similar to phthalate exposure. According to studies, high degrees of physical contact with paraben reduced sperm counts in male animals. \n\n5. Oils \nIngredients generated from petroleum and mineral oils are found in many products. They are inexpensive, odourless, and never go bad, making them a favourite among cosmetic makers. Manufacturers might use this as a hydrating element in cleansers, according to Levine. Additionally, while some types of oil can clog pores and cause breakouts, others do in fact add moisture. Levine advises employing oil-free cleansers unless your skin is exceptionally dry. Make sure the product doesn't contain propylene glycol, paraffin, mineral oil, butylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, or petrolatum by checking the ingredients list. Instead, opt for pure plant oils that are natural and rich in nutrition without clogging your pores. \n\nWe hope that the information provided here will be helpful to you as you search for the top men's face wash. It's crucial to maintain good facial and physical wellness. The easiest approach to achieve this is to stay away from face washes that contain possibly dangerous substances. Because of this, Tiege Hanley takes great satisfaction in employing the greatest skin-care ingredients on the market. For instance, we utilise ammonium lauryl sulphate, a significantly superior ingredient, in our face cleanser instead of SLS and SLES (ALS). ALS is considerably more effective in removing dirt and filth from the surface layers of your facial skin without running the risk of the product penetrating and damaging the much more sensitive underlying layers of skin.",

    intro: "The days when seeming untidy was a mark of manliness are long gone. You don't need to get mani-pedis to be a manly man; women want a man who keeps himself clean and maintained. And while there is a tonne of information available on beauty advice for women, there isn't as much for males. Men, you too need a skin care routine. It's not just for women. Male skin needs additional care in addition to washing and moisturising. You must adhere to this simple skin care routine to prevent dry, dull, and brittle skin. Here is a list of helpful grooming advice for men that we have put together",
    content: "1. CTM IS ESSENTIAL \nMen should follow the same CTM routine as women, which includes cleaning, toning, and moisturising. Every day, they are exposed to toxins including cigarette smoke, automobile exhaust, and pollution that harms their skin. Men also often have thicker, more oily skin than women. They must use an effective facial cleanser that is suitable for all skin types. To cleanse your skin and get rid of dead skin cells, cleansing is necessary. Use a gentle cleanser that won't dry out your skin. Men are slack about washing their faces before getting into bed, which leads to comedones. To avoid whiteheads, blackheads, and acne, cleansing is essential. You can even use a straightforward rose water remedy for toning. \nAdditionally, moisturising aids in treating and preventing dry, cracked, and dull skin. Applying a heavy moisturiser to your skin and body will help heal itchy skin, which is uncomfortable. There are moisturisers that are light and keep your skin protected for a number of hours. Thick moisturiser does not necessarily mean greasy formula. \n\n2. ALWAYS APPLY SUNSCREEN \nSunscreen is another item that men frequently overlook. A sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 30 must be used. The sun's rays damage the colour and texture of your skin, not the heat, which produces tanning. Apply it to your hands and face to reduce tanning. Apply the sunscreen 15 minutes before leaving the house to ensure optimum absorption. \n\n3. EXFOLIATE DAILY \nUtilize SCRUB by Tiege Hanley twice per week. Wet your face, then squeeze out a nickel-sized amount onto your palm, spreading it across your forehead (ensuring that the T-Zone is covered), down the sides of your nose, between your eyes, and down your chin. SCRUB reaches deep into your pores to eliminate bacteria and dead skin. \n\n4. AVOID WRINKLES \nParticularly lacking in perspiration and oil glands, the skin surrounding the eyes is more prone to under-eye dehydration. Eventually, this shows up as wrinkles and fine lines. Apply moisturising eye cream around your eyes every morning and before night to avoid this. Pick from the different men's eye lotions that are sold in stores. \n\n5. LIPS AGE FAST \nYou must also pay close attention to your lips. They might also appear awful if they sunburn or get chapped. To solve all of these issues and to keep your lips soft and supple, use a quality lip balm. Did you also know that lips deteriorate over time? You may see the fine lines if you look attentively in the mirror. The lips appear chapped as the years pass. Men lack the benefit of makeup to cover up this impression. When using lip balm, they should always use one with a high SPF during the day and one that is hydrating and nourishing at night.  \n\n6. MANICURE FOR MEN \nManicures are not just for ladies. Even guys need to watch their hands closely. Hands must be washed, and nails must be nicely trimmed. Add this to your list of \"beauty advice for men\" and watch the transformation. \n\n7. KEEP YOUR BEARD CLEAN \nIf you believe that growing a beard adds to your sense of style, go ahead and do it. But make sure to maintain everything tidy so that worries about itching don't get in the way of you and your loved one enjoying your food and chat. Simply adhere to some fundamental hygiene rules. Washing your beard with a face cleanser or shampoo is the best course of action. But watch out for over-shampooing your beard. Natural oils that keep your beard healthy and moisturised may be completely removed. After washing it, you can also use some fragrant beard oil.",

Your complexion can look harsh and dull due to a multitude of factors, including the environment, stress, and food. After all, healthier skin is smoother skin. Both internal and exterior factors, such as your health and food, can affect the texture of your skin. External factors include things like pollution and skin care products. Age-related natural changes also take place. \nWrinkles and other skin changes are a natural part of ageing and are nothing to be ashamed of. If you want flawless skin, keep reading.",
    content: "<strong>4 Tips to make your skin smoother</b> \n\n• Drink plenty of water: What we put in our bodies as well as what we put on our faces is the key to having healthy skin. Our body contains roughly 80% water, and for cells to operate properly, they require water, according to Holmes. Your cells, including those in your skin, become more plumped up when you drink more water, enabling them to function more effectively and remove pollutants. Drinking water will make your skin appear moisturised, nourished, and healthy. Drink 8–10 glasses of water each day to maintain a smooth complexion. \n\n• Exfoliate regularly: Exfoliating is something you can do to acquire baby-soft skin. Exfoliation removes dead skin cells off the surface of the skin as well as debris, bacteria, filth, and buildup that have accumulated there. Exfoliation cleans the skin of oils and impurities, aids in product penetration, and boosts circulation and cellular turnover. There are several options for exfoliating your face if you're not sure how to do it: chemical exfoliants, mechanical exfoliants, or exfoliators that combine both. Depending on your skin type, you can select an exfoliating technique. It is advised to use an exfoliant containing alpha hydroxy acids, beta hydroxy acids, or enzymes if you have dry, rough skin. \n\n• Use a honey face mask: By using a common household item that is wonderful for your skin, honey, you may take advantage of all the  advantages of exfoliating. Enjoy this revitalizer for all the skin- friendly properties of honey, and create your own face mask using the  organic exfoliant. For a moisturising complexion enhancer, combine one spoonful of raw honey or Manuka honey with two tablespoons of whole-fat Greek yoghurt. Apply on your face for 15 to 20 minutes, then remove with a warm washcloth after soaking it in lukewarm water. \n\n• Use the right moisturizer: Finding the perfect moisturiser for your skin type can help you get the most out of your facial lotion and keep your complexion nice and silky. If your skin is dry, you should use ceramides to provide your skin cells some moisture. \n\nIt's not necessary to go on a shopping binge for an entirely new product line to get flawless skin. Instead, making minor adjustments to your everyday routine can have a significant impact on the appearance and feel of your skin. By using these methods you can get a glowing skin.",

However, you should make it a point to maintain good health, drink plenty of water, and practise good skincare habits.",
    content: "<strong>These steps will help maintain normal skin type:</b> \n\n• Cleansing: It is disgusting to not wash your skin. However, using the wrong kind of cleanser when washing your face could severely dry it out and possibly cause acne. \nIt's important to pick a gentle cleanser that gets rid of debris and makeup without robbing your skin of its protective oils. For regular skin, I prefer milk cleansers because they are neither overly emollient nor excessively stripping. But if foaming formulas are more your style, choose one that is mild and makes very little lather. The gentler it is, the less foam it produces. \n\n• Stay hydrated: Your skin could get dry and flaky if you don't receive enough water during the day. Additionally, it may cause overproduction of sebum. \n\n• Wear sunscreen: If you neglect using sunscreen, your skin may not appear to be bothered right now. 90% of premature ageing is caused by the sun. You are aware of sagging, dark spots, and wrinkles. Just think about the harm you could prevent if you applied sunscreen daily. Sure, even in the snow. even when it pours. The stealthy wrinkle-causing UVA rays are there from the moment the sun rises to the minute it sets, can pass through glass and clouds, and can even be reflected off of snow. \n\n• Moisturize: For any skin type, moisturisers are essential. They keep the skin hydrated and stop it from producing excess sebum. \n\n• Remove your makeup before sleeping: Breakouts can result from makeup clogging pores. After a long day, you should take it off to prevent that. \n\n• Wash/Cleanse your face before sleeping: Every night before going to bed, wash your face, even if you don't wear makeup. Pores can become clogged by outside dirt and bacteria. \n\nThese are the methods to take care of your normal skin type. If you don't know what type of skin do you have you can read this out!",

    content: "<strong>The Perfect Body: </b> We have various types of body looks as a human.  \nThe first one is called“Ectomorph,” where the body weight is usually way below the average weight of their height. They usually have a fast metabolism and eat nonstop without gaining weight. It is beneficial for women, thanks to the growing craze for a slim body. But the downside is if you are too thin, people judge you for being a smoker, alcoholic, anti-social, or someone who lacks leadership qualities. \nAnother body type is Endomorph, which is completely opposite to the above one. These are people with a lot of body fat. They struggle to lose weight despite following a variety of diet plans and exercise routines. \nThe final one is mesomorphic people. They can easily gain muscle while maintaining a lean, desirable physique. A mesomorph is neither overweight nor underweight. They have the large frame of an endomorph but the low body fat of an ectomorph. \n\n<strong>Breasts and Buttocks: Where Should Your Fat Go, For The Perfect Look?</b> \n\nBreasts: Research shows that people find thin women with huge breasts to be more appealing, attractive, and healthy. Compared to women with other body types, women with large breasts and a thin waist have higher levels of female hormones. \nThus, a woman with the fashionable 36-24-36 figure will have huge breasts but a slim waist. Achieving this weight can lower your risk of developing endometrial cancer, monthly irregularities, hirsutism, or excessive hair, high plasma triglycerides, diabetes, hypertension, heart attacks, and strokes. \n\nButts: Keeping your waistline in check might be difficult. Women’s bodies vary a lot throughout their lives. Hormonal fluctuations may cause your belly fat to migrate from your thighs and hips. This is clear from the fact that most women gain a lot of bellies fat after giving birth. A small waist is simple to attain. You must include oblique-focused activities in your workout plan. The bulky abdominal muscles that round the torso are called obliques. \n\n<strong>The Confidence: A major determiner for the perfect look.</b> \nWhen we are confident, we believe we can do anything and have something to contribute. When it works well, it’s a bright, giving a sensation as opposed to a conceited, look-at-me emotion. With confidence, we can accomplish our goals without exerting too much effort. When individuals believe in their own abilities and appreciate themselves, they have a  sense of internal control. This is the power that comes with self- confidence. \n\n When a confident person enters a room: head held high, solid handshake, friendly smile, and captivating eye contact, we connect with their comfortable speaking, smooth body language, and commanding demeanour.",

In addition, the natural environment is polluted with hazardous substances that can aggravate skin conditions. Taking precaution with skin care products can help reduce the risk of exposure to these harmful substances. Furthermore, taking precautions while using skin care products is important to avoid reactions to certain ingredients or allergens. For example, if you have sensitive skin, it is important to read the label carefully before purchasing a product to ensure it does not contain any ingredients that may irritate your skin. Taking precaution while using skin care products is essential to maintain healthy skin and protect it from potential damage.",
    content: "1. Check skin requirements before purchasing any product: Picking skincare products at random from the store's shelves is a formula for disaster. You could get really bad outcomes if you don't know what your skin needs or what's in the skincare products you buy. Ask yourself questions like, \"Is my skin dry or oily?\" instead. Do I have dark spots or relatively even skin? Asking yourself \"Am I worried about wrinkles or breakouts?\" will help you decide what kind of product you require. \n\n2. Read product description sincierly: Unfortunately, a lot of chemicals used in cosmetics and skincare products have a bad reputation. They are however still used by some manufacturers since they are affordable and efficient. As a result, you should carefully check the labels of the things you use to find out what's inside. Due to the fact that manufacturers frequently utilize numerous confusing chemical trade names, the list of potentially dangerous compounds is lengthy and challenging to study. Therefore, if in doubt, don't use anything you can't pronounce! \n\n3. When not in use, securely close the containers: Your skincare products will stay fresh for longer if they are properly sealed, which will protect them from moisture. When products are left open when not in use, their lifespan will be shortened and mould development may result. \n\n4. Do a patch test: With any new skincare product you use, it is advisable to conduct a patch test. Before applying it to a wider region of your body, such as your face, arms, or legs, you can use this to test it for any potential allergic responses or irritants. Just apply a small amount of the ointment to the inside of your elbow or wrist, then wait 48 to 72 hours. If you have a negative reaction, you'll notice it rather soon. You should stop using that product right once if you suffer any itching, burning, redness, or swelling. \n\n5. Use one product at one time: If you're using multiple different skincare products, it's tough to tell which one is triggering a reaction. It can be challenging to have patience, but it's best to wait and test one new product at a time for at least a week before attempting another. So these are the 5 most important precautions one must take while using using any product for skin care.",

Avoid Thick Sticky Hair Products: We frequently coat our hair in multiple layers of product, making it sticky. Few individuals typically use thick serums and styling creams to hold their hair in place, but these products can really injure you more than usual since they attract more contaminants. To keep the cuticles healthy and free radicals at bay, choose water-based products rather than ones that are oil-based. \n\n3.

Additionally, daily hair washing can prevent dandruff and itching of the scalp. Additionally, go with a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo. \n\n4. Prevent Heat Styling Products: We frequently use different style products throughout the holiday season, but we forget that the heat and high temperatures harm the hair, weakening the strands and increasing the likelihood of hair fall, hair thinning, and grey hair.

Due to a variety of reasons, some people may be more naturally able to attain a radiant appearance than others. \n\nHere are some factors that lead to influence health of the skin: \n\n• Genetics: A person's genes may make them more likely to have dry or dull skin. Genetics is connected to some dry skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis. \n\n• Habits: Consumption of water, nutrition, sleep, stress, and exercise are all factors that might affect the skin. The skin care items someone utilises might also improve or hurt their skin's health. \n\n• Dust and pollution exposure: Your skin might be suffering if you work in a dusty setting. Dust, toxins, and chemical exposure can clog pores and give you dull-looking skin. Acne breakouts may also be triggered by pollutants. Smart skin care practises are the strongest defence against environmental influences on the skin.  \n\n<strong>Tips to get glowing, healthy looking skin that's acne free and blemish free?</b> \nHaving beautiful skin is something that many people aspire to. While some people view glowing skin as a cosmetic goal, others view it as an outward indicator of good health. The brightness of the skin can be increased in a variety of ways. People can adjust their food and lifestyle to enhance the condition of their skin. There are numerous skin care and makeup products available on the market that can mimic radiant skin. \n\n• Cleansing: Cleaning solutions assist in removing grime, makeup, and surplus oil from the skin. It is crucial to choose a cleaner that is mild, pH-balanced, free of harsh chemicals, and does not contain soap or other cleaning agents. Cleanse your skin after a workout, before bed, and right after waking up. Instead of using cold or hot water, use warm water, then pat the skin dry with a fresh towel. \n\n• Shaving: Shaving rashes, ingrown hairs, and discomfort are all common side effects of hair removal. \nTo prevent this: \n• Wet the skin and hair \n• Apply shaving cream or balm to lubricate the skin \n• Use a clean, sharp razor to shave in the direction of the hair's growth \n• Rinse the razor after each pass; and allow the razor to dry completely after use.  \n\n• Moisturizing: Water is added to the skin via moisturisers. The AAD advises using moisturiser as away after cleansing to lock in moisture in the skin for optimum benefits. While people with dry skin may choose a thicker moisturiser that incorporates oils or butters, those with oily skin may prefer an oil-free moisturiser. \n\n• Reduce Stress: Numerous factors, including stress, can have an effect on the skin. It may increase skin inflammation, reduce blood flow to the skin, and slow skin healing, according to scientists. We can reduce stress by practicing yoga, breathing exercises, or mindfulness. \n\n• Other Products: Depending on a person's particular concerns, there are several products that could aid in achieving healthy skin. For instance, popular products that dissolve the top layer of skin cells to make room for new cells beneath are known as chemical exfoliants. These can be used to enhance the texture and look of skin. Summary \n\nSkin that glows naturally is usually healthy and well-hydrated skin.

Your hair follicles and hair shaft start to shrink over time, causing thinning and hair loss—and slower than usual hair growth. Here are some tips from our experts on how to support your hair as you age.",
    content: "<strong>Recognize the causes of hair changes</b> \nAccording to Heather Butterworth, Affinage Salon Professional and National Artistic Educator, our hormones alter as we get older. Your hair sheds more frequently and doesn't grow back as rapidly because of shrinking hair follicles, the expert claims. \"Your scalp's oil glands start to coast and get lax about refilling themselves, which can cause stiffness, itching, and dry, brittle ends.\" \n\nHow to update your hair care routine? The quantity of hair on your head is referred to as hair density. You probably have thin hair if, even without splitting your hair, you can still see your scalp. With a new hair care routine or prescription drugs, hair loss or low hair density can be improved. You can locate the hair care programme and products that are ideal for your hair with a little assistance. \n\nShampoo and conditioner \nThe basis for good hair is a healthy scalp. It's crucial to maintain healthy scalp nutrition. Depending on your hair type, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) suggests frequent shampooing. Using shampoos and conditioners can help thicken hair and cosmetically volumize hair, especially in cases of thinning hair or hair loss, according to a 2015 study reviewed by Trusted Source. Minoxidil (Rogaine) may be able to help if your hair has to be thickened. Although it can be purchased over the counter, it's important to think about possible side effects, some of which can be serious, before using this treatment. \n\nStraight and wavy hair \nYour hair may have a propensity to become oily if it is straight or wavy. If you have straight or waved hair, you might need to employ a more delicate hair care routine, claims a 2015 article from Trusted Source. \n• Dry shampoos or mild shampoos may be used in this situation. \n• Using texture sprays on towel-dried hair will assist to give it more volume. \n• You might notice that the texture of your hair naturally changes as you get older. \nWhen your hair is dry, do not comb or brush your straight or wavy hair. This may cause split ends, giving the appearance of brittle hair. \n\nCurly and coily hair \nCurly and coily hair types frequently lack moisture and are more prone to drying out than straight and wavy hair. Curly and coily hair is more prone to breakage and dryness than other hair types since it tends to get thinner and weaker as you age. The appropriate regimen and hair care products can keep your curls healthy and looking fantastic if you're wanting to give them more bounce and sparkle  \nConsider shampoos and conditioners made especially for curly hair when making product purchases. These goods can help your hair retain moisture. It is recommended to stay away from any hair products that can weigh your hair down or dry it out. \nThe AAD offers the following advice for taking care of curly or coily hair: \n• Wash your hair only as necessary. \n• Keep the moisture in your hair. \n• Look after your scalp. \n• Straighten your hair. \n• Sun protection for your curls. \n• While you sleep, take care of your hair. \n\nAfter shampooing, your hair is stripped of its natural protective barrier.

There are five primary varieties of skin: oily, normal, combination, dry, and sensitive. Each has advantages and disadvantages of its own. Everyone requires the basic products (such cleanser, moisturiser, and SPF), but the ideal formulations for each kind of skin might differ greatly. Therefore, if you want to create a routine that actually works for you, it's essential to understand where your skin fits within the spectrum of skin types.",
    content: "<strong>What Are The Five Main Types Of Skin?</b> \n\n• Oily Skin: Sebum, the skin's natural oil, is produced at a rate that is higher than normal in those with oily skin. Skin issues like blackheads and enlarged pores are frequently present along with this excessive oiliness, which can make the skin appear glossy or greasy. People with oily skin may also be more prone to breakouts because blocked pores are a key cause of them. \n\n• Dry Skin: It is fairly common to have dry skin, which is defined by insufficient moisture in the epidermis, the skin's outermost layer. Both men and women can have dry skin, although older people are far more likely to have it. Older people's skin contains fewer lubricants and natural oils. Dry skin is more prevalent in places like the arms, hands, and particularly the lower legs. The amount of water retained in the skin is significantly influenced by environmental conditions, including temperature and humidity. \n\n• Combination Skin: Combination skin combines both dry and oily skin types. Sebum, which is produced by the body to hydrate the skin, is what causes the oil to form. In a mixed skin type, your T-zone, which includes your forehead, nose, and chin, is typically oily because more sebum is produced there, while the rest of your face is typically dry because there is insufficient sebum production. Given that they are effectively two different skin types combined into one, mixture skin types have many issues. \n\n• Sensitive Skin: Skin that is sensitive has a greater sensitivity to stimuli, such as some skincare products. When exposed to stimuli, some persons only experience mild irritability, whilst others frequently endure redness, itching, and discomfort. However, sensitivity isn't always apparent; occasionally, it's just a matter of how the skin feels. \n\n• Normal Skin: Skin that is balanced feels neither either dry nor overly greasy. It doesn't flake, break out easily, or feel tight or greasy. Normal-skinned people often have small pores, smooth skin, and are less sensitive or prone to blemishes. Normal skin doesn't have any particular problems or worries, but it still needs the right treatment to look and feel its best. By retaining moisture and strengthening your skin's natural barrier, the optimum normal skin routine keeps your skin hydrated. \n\nThese are the most common skin types you will see, you can refer this blog to know how you can take care of your skin type.",
